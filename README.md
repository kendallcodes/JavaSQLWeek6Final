# JavaSQLWeek6Final

Our team struggled to be able to pull and push from github. 
We spent hours on this, including two mentor sessions with Zach, and two session with Nick.

The check-ins do not reflect the work done!

Kendall wrote the certification piece (entity and Dao), John wrote on the album piece (entity and Dao)
and Lisa wrote on the artist piece (entity and Dao).  We all worked on Menu, and Lisa contributed DBConnection.

We did our troubleshooting together over Zoom, and Lisa typed the changes, and checked them in, 
but it was a group effort!

Thanks for understanding!
